# Vida Rucli's website

This one-page website is built on Are.na, specifically [this channel](https://www.are.na/vida-rucli/vida-website).

## Blocks as content

The site's content is divided into Are.na blocks. Elements are populated with a block's content using a data attribute.

For example: `data-block-id="36003481"`. 

## Image Scroll

The site has a long image scroll that is populated with all the images from [this channel](https://www.are.na/vida-rucli/vida-website). The channel is queried, filtered by `block.class === 'Image'` and appended to `#images`.
